# INST126_Proj2
This project implements the game of Hangman. It also implements the decoding of the guess word.

To use the program, type in the character you want to guess once the input window shows up. If the guessing character matches with some characters in the guessing word, the word will be updated. If the guessing character does not match any character in the guessing word, you will lose a live and if you are not able to guess the word after 10 attempts, you lose. If you are able to guess the word under 10 guessing attempts, the decrypted word will also be shown at the end.
